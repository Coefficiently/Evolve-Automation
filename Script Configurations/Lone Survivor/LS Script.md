This is a script config specifically made for Lone Survivor farming. Every Lone Survivor completion awards roughly 2800 Anti-plasmids/120 Phage and 1 basic servant. Anti-plasmids and phage both give good generic production and storage bonuses and servants allow more pop for servant jobs. Every servant will mainly be used for the scavenger job where they provide a generic 0.12% production buff per scavenger that scales linearly. This effect can be further increased with grabbing the scavenger trait which makes the scavenger job always available even on non trashed planets along with the buff increased up to 0.18% and +34% effectiveness on trashed planets.
