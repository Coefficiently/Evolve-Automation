## Progress Order

#### Research and build items may not trigger in the exact order presented here due to them being able to be triggered simultaneously

#### When it says build (number) it is refering to the TOTAL number and not how many additional to build, such as build 1 factory >> build 2 factory is not 3 factories total but is saying build 1 factory total >> build 2 factory for 2 total

#### Matter replicator management is fairly important for LS and it's hard to give a strict order of how to use it since it varies a lot depending on your prestige, early on it will be used for unobtainium (Womling lab/Disease lab) and elerium (Womling lab). You will also want to keep certain resources above a minimum to maintain building upkeep, I like to keep Oil/Helium above 10k and elerium above 1500. Helium/Oil replication will also be important for the 2.2mil helium needed for research/building and oil for the 800k needed for tau red orbital platforms. Replicator can be used for titanium to help build your first 7 extractor ships as well. Towards the end of runs during ringworld it will mostly be used for orichalcum and towards the very end graphene for Garden of Eden building.

- Imitate Djinni
    - When switching to sand genus we lose imitate and add wish to custom
- Mimic None
    - Want to use starting resources before losing all lumber
- Job to professor
- Government Technocracy
- Research Limited Wish
- Research Governor
    - Depending on your script you may want to change where this in your order since it changes seed when you hire a governor and can change what your greater wish will give you
- Governor Bureaucrat
    - Only useful governor
- Research Fanaticism
- Research Greater Wish
- Research Ancient Theology
- Research Deify Ancients
    - Don't build **ANYTHING** until this is complete, it gives us R3 empower which is needed to rank all of our traits to max such as bloated which changes resource costs
- Research Alien Outpost Device
- Build 3 Tau Fusion Generator
- Build 6 Tau Orbital Station
- Build 8 Tau Colony
- Build 8 Tau Casino
    - Can change casino count depending on prestige
- Build 5 Stock Exchange (Prestige dependant)
- Mimic Heat
    - No longer need starting lumber/plywood
- Change job to BANKER and use greater money wish
- **Greater Wish for money if == money wish, otherwise research and select governor for seed reroll, if wish !== money then soft reset, if using RNG Prediction script addition you can just use an eval to determine what the next N wishes will be, if not using RNG Prediction you can just cast wish and if day(total) > 5 and money < (your money required to finish LS (around 4-5bil) then you soft reset)**
- Job to professor
- Research Antimatter Replicator
- **Disease Lab vs Womling Lab first depends on overall run speed and what you're gated on, runs longer than 400 days will most likely follow the order listed here**
- Research Tau Ceti Cultivation
- Research Tau Ceti Manufacturing
- Job to pit miner for chyrsotile
- Build 1 Tau High-Tech Factory
- Government Corpocracy
- Build 7 Tau Orbital Station
- Build 3 Tau High-Tech Factory
- Job to professor
    - Make sure to stay on pit miner until all 3 factories are built and you have enough chrysotile stored for disease lab
- Research Meet the Neighbors
- Build 1 Tau Disease Lab
- Job to scientist
- Government Technocracy
- Mimic Small
    - Allows subjugate to not cost chrysotile and only money
- Build Subjugate Womlings
    - **VERY** important that this entire progress is designed with ONLY subjugtate in mind, subjugate allows you to build overseers that don't cost titanium 
- Mimic Heat
- Research Womling Entertainment
- Research Womling Science
- Job to pit miner
- Government Federation
- Build 2 Tau Red Womling Lab
- Build 9 Tau Orbital Station
- Build 11 Tau Colony
- Build 8 Tau Red Orbital Platform
- Build 13 Tau Red Womling Village
- Build 5 Tau Red Womling Farm
- Build 3 Tau Red Womling Mine
- Build 3 Tau Red Womling Theater
- Mimic Avian
- Build 6 Tau Red Overseer
- Build 14 Tau Casino
    - Can change casino count depending on prestige/preference
- Mimic Heat
- Job to scientist
    - As long as research isn't capped while waiting for womling tech level 1 otherwise stay on pit miner
    - From here on changing jobs from scientist/pit miner will vary a lot depending on when your research is complete and when you require chrysotile, can't go wrong with just putting job as pit miner when knowledge isn't required
